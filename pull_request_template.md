## Delete this section

Thank you for contributing to H3A-GWAS!  Below is a template for your pull
request to help us make sure that all the needed commits have
been made before it is merged, and to document why the changes were made.
Please edit it as appropriate.  You can always make the pull request,
make a few more commits, and then edit this document further.

## Purpose

Use this section to describe the purpose of your pull request.
Was there a bug that needed to be fixed?  Is there a reason why a new feature
would be helpful or why the documentation needed to be updated?

## Approach

What did you do to address the problem?  What sorts of changes were made
to the code and/or documentation, and why?  Note that you don't need to
put too much (or possibly any) code here since your commits are also
visible.

## Testing

After making your changes, which workflows did you test?  What dataset(s),
parameters, and profile(s) did you use?  Were Docker containers used, and
did you run the pipeline locally or on the cloud?

## Checklist

You can still make the pull request if you haven't completed this checklist,
but you may be asked to make additional commits before the request is merged.
You can delete or strikethough some of these items if you are certain they are
not necessary.  Feel free also to add any items that you didn't already discuss
in the above section.
